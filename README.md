# AutomaticCellCounter
These MATLAB scripts are written to automatically count cells in fluorescence microscopic images. 
It is written as part of a master thesis by Tom Niessink, at the University of Twente (2021)

The script Automatic_cell_counter.m allows the user to define a segmentation filter before counting and can count single images.

The script Folder_counter.m automatically counts al cells in a defined folder with fixed segmentation settings.

The script countcells.m is a function which contains both the segmentation as the counting part of the script.

The example folder contains five example .TIF images which can be used to test the software.
